This project is a powerful **AI-driven job & skill recommendation system** that intelligently analyzes your resume and matches it to the most relevant job listings and suggest some On market demand skills that you have missed out.It uses a blend of **LLMs, NLP, translation, semantic similarity, fuzzy matching, and job market data** to guide career decisions with precision.

##  Features

-  **Resume Parsing** (PDF support)
-  **Technical Skill Extraction** using LLM (Mistral-7B)
-  **Job Matching** via:
  - Keyword-based filtering
  - Semantic skill similarity with `SentenceTransformer`
-  **Real-time Job Fetching** from [Arbeitnow Job Board API](https://www.arbeitnow.com/)
-  **Multi-criteria Ranking** (salary, location, work mode, company culture, etc.)
-  **LLM-Based Career Evaluation** using Azure OpenAI (`GPT-4o`, `LLaMA`)
-  **Skill Gap Analysis** & Recommendations
-  **Translation** of job descriptions using `DeepTranslator`
-  **Interactive Gradio UI** with two tabs:
  - Job Recommender
  - Resume Analysis by Job Title

##  File Structure

- `main.py` â€” Complete pipeline with job fetching, skill extraction, evaluation, and Gradio UI.
- `jobs.csv` â€” CSV file of job titles and key skills used for skill-based filtering and fuzzy match.
- `semantic_top5_jobs.txt` â€” Output file saving the top 5 matched jobs and their analysis.

##  How It Works

1. **Resume Upload** â†’ Extracts technical skills using LLM.
2. **Job Fetching** â†’ Jobs are fetched from Arbeitnow API or `jobs.csv`.
3. **Keyword + Semantic Matching** â†’ Finds top jobs based on fuzzy and semantic scores.
4. **Job Transformation** â†’ Uses LLM to extract job insights (salary, work culture, etc.).
5. **Fit Prediction** â†’ Final evaluation ranks jobs based on weighted criteria.
6. **Skill Gap Analysis** â†’ Suggests technical skills to improve based on job demands.

##  Evaluation Metrics

Each job is scored based on:

- Long-term potential
- Work culture
- Salary fit
- Transport & location fit
- Facilities offered
